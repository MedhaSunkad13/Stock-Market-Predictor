# Stock-Market-Predictor

Stock Market Terminology:

The stock market is a marketplace where sellers offer their shares for sale, and buyers purchase these shares. The price of a stock fluctuates every second based on the dynamics of demand and supply.

1. In this ML project, I have developed an end-to-end web application utilizing a machine learning model to predict the stock market price of a stock. 

2. This entire project is developed in the Python programming language. 

3. The application encompasses data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment, providing a seamless interface for users to input stock data and receive predictions. Additionally, it includes data visualization tools to help users understand the trends and factors influencing stock prices.

Working of Stock Market Predictor:

1. To use the stock market predictor, you need to enter the ticker symbol of a multinational company, such as TCS.NS (Tata Consultancy Services), GOOG (Alphabet Inc.), MSFT (Microsoft Corporation), etc.

2. To find the ticker symbol for a particular stock, you can head on to this website linked below, just enter the company name Ex: TCS.

3. On entering the ticker symbol, the application retrieves and displays a table containing the stock's open, high, low, close, adjusted close prices, and volume data for the past 10 years, ranging from January 2014 to May 2024.

3. Table columns:

    1. Open: The stock's opening price at the start of the trading day.
    2. High: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.
    3. Low: The lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
    4. Close: The stock's closing price at the end of the trading day.
    5. Adjusted Close: The closing price adjusted for corporate actions such as dividends, stock splits, etc.
    6. Volume: The number of shares traded during the day.

4. Additionally, the application generates several graphs to aid in the analysis:

    1.  Price vs. MA50: A graph comparing the stock's price against the   50-day moving average.
    2.  Price vs. MA50 vs. MA100: A graph comparing the stock's price against the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.
    3. Price vs. MA100 vs. MA200: A graph comparing the stock's price against the 100-day and 200-day moving averages.
    4. Original Price vs. Predicted Price: A graph comparing the actual stock prices with the predicted prices generated by the machine learning model.
